nfrastructure Design

## Overview
This project involves designing a web infrastructure for hosting a website, with a focus on different configurations and their implications. The project includes tasks that cover simple web stacks, distributed infrastructures, secured and monitored setups, and scaling strategies.

## Tasks
1. **Simple Web Stack**
   - Design a one-server web infrastructure for `www.foobar.com`.
   - Components: Nginx web server, application server, MySQL database, and domain name configuration.

2. **Distributed Web Infrastructure**
   - Design a three-server infrastructure for `www.foobar.com`.
   - Components: Load balancer, multiple web and application servers, and a Primary-Replica database.

3. **Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure**
   - Enhance the distributed setup with security and monitoring.
   - Components: Firewalls, SSL certificates, and monitoring clients.

4. **Scale Up**
   - Design a scalable infrastructure by separating components onto different servers.
   - Components: Load balancer cluster and dedicated servers for each function.

## Diagrams
- Each task includes a diagram illustrating the infrastructure design.
- Diagrams can be found in the respective task markdown files.

## Requirements
- Each task must include a whiteboard diagram and an explanation of the components.
- Screenshots of the completed tasks must be uploaded to an image hosting service.
- A GitHub repository will be used to document the project.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of each component in web infrastructure.
- Understand concepts like SPOF, load balancing, and database replication.
- Design infrastructures that are secure, monitored, and scalable.
